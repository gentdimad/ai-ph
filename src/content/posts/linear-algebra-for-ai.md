Behind every AI model is math—and at the heart of that math is linear algebra. If you want to truly understand how machine learning models work, learning the basics of vectors and matrices is essential.

## Why Linear Algebra Matters

Data in AI is often represented as vectors and matrices. Images, text embeddings, and datasets are all structured numerically so models can process them efficiently.

```python
import numpy as np

A = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])
B = np.array([[5], [6]])

result = np.dot(A, B)
print(result)
```

Matrix multiplication like this powers neural networks and many ML algorithms.

## Core Concepts to Know

Vectors represent data points.  
Matrices represent datasets or transformations.  
Dot products measure similarity.  
Eigenvalues help in dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.

Understanding these foundations makes complex topics like deep learning far less mysterious.

## Final Thoughts

AI is not magic—it’s mathematics applied to data. Strengthening your linear algebra fundamentals opens the door to deeper AI understanding and more confident adoption.
